# Draw.io architecture diagrams

Produces native, editable `.drawio` XML — never a flattened image, never Mermaid as the
final artifact. Style rules are learned from an analysed corpus of real architecture
pages, each rule carrying its evidence count; the icons are eighteen packs -
about 4,800 marks - bundled with this skill and resolved by one search.

Scripts live in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/arkitect-drawio/scripts`.
Read `references/style-guide.md` before laying anything out, and
`references/pattern-catalog.md` to pick a starting pattern.

## Workflow

1. **Interview until you both mean the same thing.** One question at a time, each
   carrying your recommended answer, walking the design tree in dependency order. See
   [Interview first](#interview-first). Never ask about styling — that is this skill's
   job. Do not start drawing while a branch that would change the drawing is unresolved.

2. **Pick a pattern and state assumptions.** Choose the nearest entry in
   `references/pattern-catalog.md`. Write down every architectural assumption you made;
   they go in the final report and, where useful, in a note box on the canvas.

3. **Resolve icons — bundled packs first.**
   ```bash
   node scripts/find-icon.mjs "bedrock"                    # rank matches, metadata only
   node scripts/find-icon.mjs "cloud run" --context gcp    # bias toward the stack in play
   node scripts/find-icon.mjs --cell <id> --label "Amazon Bedrock" --x 0 --y 0
   ```
   The search answers with `confident: true` or with the reason it is not, plus the
   alternatives. **A result that is not confident is a question, not an answer** —
   pick an id deliberately, narrow with `--pack`, or ask. Do not take the first row
   because it was first.

   Sixty-nine products are catalogued without artwork, because their marks carry no
   redistribution licence. Those come back as `bytes: "on-demand"` with the exact
   `fetch-logo` command to run. Run it, then use the cached logo.

   If nothing matches, fall back to a built-in `mxgraph.aws4.*` shape, then to the MCP
   `search_shapes` tool, then to a plain labelled box that you call out in the report.
   **Never** swap in a different product's icon to fill a gap.

4. **Generate the file.** Write a spec and build it; this applies the style tokens,
   embeds the icon data directly in each cell, and keeps the layout collision-free:
   ```bash
   node scripts/build-diagram.mjs my-spec.json --out "path/to/diagram.drawio"
   ```
   `assets/templates/starter-architecture.spec.json` is a working example of the spec
   format. Declare the packs the diagram draws from so ties resolve inside the right
   stack, and pin a single stubborn node with its own `pack`:
   ```json
   { "context": { "packs": ["gcp", "devops"] },
     "nodes": [{ "id": "q", "kind": "icon", "icon": "kafka", "pack": "streaming-orchestration" }] }
   ```
   A spec whose edges or parents name something that does not exist is refused
   before anything is written, with every problem listed (exit 1). Fix the spec;
   never drop the edge to make it build.
   Hand-written XML is fine too — copy the exact style strings from the style
   guide — but embedded icons must use the comma-only data URI form
   (`data:image/svg+xml,<base64>`), because `;` terminates a draw.io style.

5. **Never overwrite blind.** `build-diagram.mjs` writes a timestamped sibling backup
   before replacing an existing file. If you edit XML by any other route, call
   `backupExisting()` or copy the file yourself first.

6. **Validate.**
   ```bash
   node scripts/validate-drawio.mjs "path/to/diagram.drawio"
   ```
   Errors (duplicate ids, missing parents, broken edge endpoints, unreadable embedded
   images) must be fixed. Warnings about overlaps and tight labels are judgement calls —
   check them against the render.

7. **Render and actually look at it.**
   ```bash
   node scripts/render-drawio.mjs "path/to/diagram.drawio" --out-dir .analysis/renders --width 2200
   # Or from the repository root:
   node bin/arkitect.mjs drawio render "path/to/diagram.drawio" --all --out-dir .analysis/renders
   ```
   Uses local Draw.io Desktop on Linux, macOS and Windows, with automatic
   `xvfb-run -a` wrapping on Linux without `DISPLAY` when available. Override
   discovery with `--drawio-exe` or `DRAWIO_EXE`. Outputs are
   `<base>.p<0-based index>.png`. The PowerShell helper remains unchanged:
   `./scripts/render-drawio.ps1 -Path "path/to/diagram.drawio" -OutDir .analysis/renders`.
   Read the PNG back as an image. Iterate until spacing, hierarchy, routing and label
   legibility hold up. A diagram that validates but reads badly is not done.
   Both helpers accept 0-based page numbers. The portable `.mjs` validates N,
   copies the selected raw `<diagram>` verbatim with original `<mxfile>`
   attributes into a temporary single-page file, exports WITHOUT Desktop's
   `--page-index`, and removes the temporary file even on failure. Compressed
   payloads remain compressed and byte-identical. Do not guess indexing from
   platform or version: Linux arm64 24.7.17 is 0-based, Windows x64 29.0.3 is
   1-based. The Windows-original `.ps1` remains unchanged. The opt-in
   `--page-index-passthrough` flag is only for debugging Desktop; it passes N
   directly on the original file without translating and can select a different
   page on a build with different indexing. See `docs/drawio-mcp.md`.
   Judge export success by a fresh non-empty output, not Chromium stderr noise.
   Extra Electron flags are opt-in: `--disable-gpu` for observed GPU errors,
   `--no-sandbox` only for a diagnosed sandbox failure. Never add them blindly.
   After a host update breaks rendering, report 🔴 and explicitly fall back to
   validate-only until fixed. Generator changes need a build, render and visual
   inspection before a PR; only committed-template renders may be attached.
   Never commit a render or upload real architecture.

8. **Open it on request.** `& 'C:\Program Files\draw.io\draw.io.exe' "<file>"`.

9. **Report.** File path, the assumptions the interview settled, validation and render
   results, any icon the resolver was not confident about or could not find, which
   third-party logos were downloaded and from where, and any deliberate deviation from
   the style guide.

## Interview first

A diagram is a claim about someone's system. Drawing the wrong claim beautifully is
worse than drawing nothing, and every wrong assumption survives into a slide deck and
gets believed. So before laying anything out, **interview the user until you both mean
the same thing** — then draw once.

**How to ask.**

- **One question at a time.** A wall of six questions gets one answer and five shrugs.
- **Always carry a recommendation.** Give your recommended answer with each question so
  "yes" is a complete reply. Say why in one line — a recommendation without a reason is
  just a guess with confidence.
- **Walk the tree in dependency order.** Answers that constrain later questions come
  first. Do not ask about failure paths before you know whether this is a context
  diagram or a component diagram.
- **Never interview about style.** Colours, fonts, spacing, connector shapes, icon
  choice, legend — those are this skill's job. Asking is an admission it is not doing it.
- **Feed answers forward.** Do not re-ask what an earlier answer already settled, and say
  when an answer changes something you had already agreed.

**The branches, in dependency order.** Skip a branch when the answer is already in the
request or genuinely cannot change the drawing.

1. **Purpose and audience.** Who reads this, and what decision does it support? An RFC
   reviewer, a client steering group and an on-call engineer need three different
   pictures of the same system. *Everything below depends on this answer.*
2. **Scope boundary.** What is inside the picture, and what is deliberately outside?
   Naming what is out is as useful as naming what is in.
3. **Level of abstraction.** One box per service, per container, or per team? Mixing
   levels in one diagram is the single most common way these go wrong.
4. **State.** As-is, to-be, or both side by side? If both, are they two pages or one
   comparison?
5. **The components — by their real product names.** "The warehouse" is not drawable;
   "Snowflake" is. This answer also picks the icon packs, so get the actual products:
   `node scripts/find-icon.mjs --list-packs`.
6. **The flows.** What moves between the components, in which direction, and which are
   synchronous versus scheduled or event-driven? Ask which flows matter enough to draw —
   every arrow costs legibility.
7. **Boundaries.** Trust, network, ownership, account/subscription/project. These become
   the containers, so they change the layout more than anything except the level.
8. **What must be visible.** Failure paths, multi-region, HA/DR, a specific control the
   audience is there to scrutinise. Ask rather than guess which of these earns space.
9. **Pages.** One page, or a set? Split by lifecycle stage or by audience, not by how
   much fits.
10. **Unknowns.** Where the user does not know, agree the treatment up front: draw it
    with a stated assumption, or leave a labelled placeholder. Never quietly invent.

**Stop when** the remaining unknowns could not change what gets drawn. Relentless means
resolving every branch that matters, not filling a quota. A one-box-to-three-boxes
flowchart needs two questions; a solution architecture for a review board needs the
ladder. Calibrate to what is actually being asked, and say when you are stopping and why.

**Then write the answers down.** They become the assumptions in your report, and the
ones that matter go into a note box on the canvas. An assumption nobody can see is an
assumption nobody can correct.

## The icon packs

One search covers all of them; `--pack` narrows to one, `--context` biases toward
several. Lower rank wins a tie, so a curated pack always beats the catch-all.

| Pack | Icons | What is in it |
|---|---|---|
| `aws` | 311 | AWS Architecture Icons, Amazon's July 2026 package |
| `azure` | 638 | Azure service icons, V24 |
| `gcp` | 249 | Google Cloud products and categories |
| `data-platforms` | 25 | Warehouses, lakehouses, query engines, BI, product analytics |
| `databases` | 37 | Relational, document, key-value, graph, vector |
| `ai-frameworks` | 34 | LLM orchestration, agent frameworks, providers |
| `ml-training` | 27 | Training, experiment tracking, the numeric stack |
| `streaming-orchestration` | 16 | Brokers, stream processors, schedulers |
| `observability` | 26 | Metrics, logs, traces, alerting, on-call |
| `devops` | 54 | IaC, CI/CD, containers, mesh, proxies, distros |
| `security-identity` | 25 | Secrets, SSO, scanning, runtime security, VPN |
| `github` | 38 | GitHub marks plus Octicon workflow concepts |
| `saas-collab` | 30 | Trackers, docs, design, comms, low-code, business SaaS |
| `languages-runtimes` | 80 | Languages, frameworks, package managers, build and test tooling |
| `file-types` | 35 | Document sheets badged with an extension |
| `agents` | 33 | Agent concepts — memory, tracing, RAG, guardrail |
| `primitives` | 43 | Generic concepts — queue, cache, load balancer |
| `brands` | 3,092 | Every other Simple Icons mark; ranked last |

`node scripts/find-icon.mjs --list-packs` prints this live.
`references/pack-index.md` lists what each curated pack contains, and which products
are catalogued without bytes. Contact sheets for every pack are in
`assets/libraries/contact-sheets/` — look at one before telling a user a pack is
missing something.

Rebuilding is only needed when `sources.json` changes:

```bash
node scripts/build-packs.mjs --verify        # committed libraries match the manifest?
node scripts/build-packs.mjs --all           # rebuild every pack and the catalog
node scripts/contact-sheet.mjs --all --png   # regenerate the review sheets
```

## Third-party product logos

The packs cover most things. Everything else — a niche vendor, an internal product,
one of the sixty-nine on-demand marks — gets its real logo, downloaded and embedded.
In the reference corpus 77 of 97 embedded images are exactly this. A generic box where
a recognisable logo belongs is a regression, not a safe default.

```bash
node scripts/fetch-logo.mjs --url https://.../logo.png --name snowflake
node scripts/fetch-logo.mjs --list
node scripts/fetch-logo.mjs --inspect snowflake
```

Then reference it in the spec by name:

```json
{ "id": "sf", "kind": "logo", "logo": "snowflake", "label": "Snowflake", "col": 3, "row": 1 }
```

**Finding the file.** Use WebSearch/WebFetch to locate the official asset, then hand the
URL to the script — the script does the binary download, not WebFetch. Good sources, in
order: the vendor's own press-kit or brand page, their GitHub organisation avatar or
`docs/` assets, Wikimedia Commons. Prefer a page that offers a downloadable asset over
scraping a rendered `<img>` out of a marketing page.

**Prefer transparent PNG, or SVG.** A logo on a baked-in white rectangle looks wrong on
the canvas and worse inside a coloured boundary. The script reports transparency for
every file it caches and warns when a PNG is opaque; if it warns, go back and find a
better source rather than shipping it. Search terms like "transparent png" or "logo svg"
usually get you there. SVG is ideal — it scales and is almost always transparent.

**Size.** Vendor logos sit at ~60–64px in the corpus, smaller than the 78px packaged
service icons. The default fits the longest side to 64px and preserves aspect, so a wide
wordmark stays wide rather than being squashed square. Stack them vertically at ~60px
inside an *external systems column* (pattern 6) when several sit together.

**Check it is the right logo.** Read the cached file back as an image before shipping
it. Brand searches return old logos, fan art and lookalikes; a wrong logo is worse than
no logo.

**Privacy.** Only the logo URL is ever requested. Never put a customer name, project
codename, hostname or anything from the diagram into a search query or URL — search the
product name alone. Downloading a public asset leaks nothing; searching
`"<customer> architecture"` does.

**Embed, never link.** The cache is local and gitignored, so a `remote-url` reference in
a cell would break for anyone else and is flagged by `validate-drawio.mjs`. `kind: "logo"`
embeds the bytes.

If you genuinely cannot find a usable logo, use a plain box with the product name and
say so in the report — do not substitute a different product's mark.

## Editing an existing diagram

- Call MCP `list_pages` first to see the page inventory.
- `get_page`/`set_page` are only safe when the page is small. Reference pages here run
  4–7 MB because of embedded images — loading one wholesale will blow up the context.
- For anything large, work page-scoped with the local scripts:
  ```bash
  node scripts/analyze-drawio.mjs "<file>" --page 0 --cells   # geometry table, no labels
  node scripts/analyze-drawio.mjs "<file>" --page 0 --images  # embedded image inventory
  ```
  then make a targeted, backup-protected edit and re-validate.
- Never call `open_drawio_xml`, `open_drawio_csv` or `open_drawio_mermaid` on anything
  derived from the user's diagrams — those open the hosted editor and would send private
  architecture off the machine.

## Non-negotiables

- Editable `.drawio` XML is the deliverable.
- Icons and logos embed in the cell, so the file renders without the palette loaded.
- Real product marks for every component, transparent background, not grey boxes.
- Orthogonal routing, square corners, no shadows, captions under icons, `#232F3E` text,
  12px body / 16px headings.
- Keep the user's own diagrams local. Never upload them anywhere. Fetching a public
  logo is fine; putting anything from the diagram into a query is not.
