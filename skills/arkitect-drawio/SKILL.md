name: arkitect-drawio
description: Create or edit editable Draw.io (.drawio) solution-architecture diagrams in the Arkitect house style, using the bundled icon packs for AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, data platforms, AI frameworks, DevOps, GitHub, file types and agent concepts. Use whenever the request involves a Draw.io/diagrams.net diagram, an AWS or cloud architecture diagram, a monitoring or observability architecture, a data-ingestion or data-pipeline architecture, an agentic/LLM system architecture, a solution-options or as-is/to-be comparison diagram, a flow or decision diagram wanted as .drawio, or an edit to an existing .drawio file.

# Draw.io architecture diagrams

Produces native, editable `.drawio` XML — never a flattened image, never Mermaid
as the final artifact. The builder applies the house style and embeds the icons;
you write a small JSON spec. Scripts live in
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/arkitect-drawio/scripts`.

## What to read

Read only what the task needs. Every path is relative to this skill.

| Task | Read |
|---|---|
| Draw a new diagram | this file, the one pattern you pick in step 2, and `assets/templates/starter-architecture.spec.json` with its PNG |
| Edit an existing `.drawio` | `references/editing.md` |
| An icon the search cannot settle, a product logo, the pack list | `references/icons.md` |
| Rendering fails, or you must explain how pages export | `references/rendering.md` |
| Hand-written XML, or a deliberate deviation from the house style | `references/style-guide.md` |

If `~/.arkitect/drawio/style-notes.md` or `patterns.md` exist
(`$ARKITECT_HOME/drawio/` when set), read them too: they are what
`/learn-drawio-style` found in the user's own diagrams, and they win over the
shipped guide. Say so in the report.

## Workflow

1. **Decide whether to ask** — see Interview first, below. Most requests are
   drawn straight away, with the assumptions stated.

2. **Pick a pattern and state assumptions.** Choose the nearest row, then read
   only that `## N.` section of `references/pattern-catalog.md`:

   | # | Use for |
   |---|---|
   | 1 | ingestion, ETL, log processing: a source → sink pipeline inside an AWS Cloud boundary |
   | 2 | naming a sub-pipeline, a proposed change or a phase with a scope box |
   | 3 | solution options, as-is/to-be, migration proposals |
   | 4 | tiered swimlanes: backend / storage / frontend, on-prem / cloud / consumer |
   | 5 | a database, schema, namespace or service holding sub-items |
   | 6 | upstream producers or downstream consumers you do not own |
   | 7 | a numbered sequence to walk a reviewer through |
   | 8 | the legend (generated when more than one connector kind is used) |
   | 9 | assumptions, open decisions, warnings |
   | 10 | an LLM agent architecture |

   Spec fragments for most of them are in `assets/templates/patterns.json`.
   Write every architectural assumption down; it goes in the report and, where
   it matters, in a note on the canvas.

3. **Resolve icons — bundled packs first.**
   ```bash
   node scripts/find-icon.mjs "bedrock" --compact          # verdict + spec node, never bytes
   node scripts/find-icon.mjs "cloud run" --context gcp --compact   # bias toward the stack
   ```
   **A result that is not `confident` is a question, not an answer**: pick an id
   deliberately, narrow with `--pack`, or ask; drop `--compact` for every detail.
   Put the id in the spec as `{ "kind": "icon", "icon": "<id>" }`; the builder
   embeds the artwork. An `onDemand` or `lifecycle` note, or no match: follow
   `references/icons.md`. A product the packs do not carry gets its real logo
   (`kind: "logo"`, same file). **Never** use a different product's icon to fill
   a gap; a labelled box named in the report is honest.

4. **Build from a spec.** First see which style this install draws with:
   ```bash
   node scripts/build-diagram.mjs --print-style
   node scripts/build-diagram.mjs my-spec.json --out "path/to/diagram.drawio"
   ```
   Write the spec next to the output file, never inside this skill's folder.
   With `"source": "override"` the user applied their own conventions: pick each
   edge `kind` by its `meaning` there, and do not fight the tokens it changed. A
   non-empty `style.errors` in the build report means the override was ignored:
   tell the user. Never pass `--defaults` for a user's diagram.

   Declare the packs in play so ties resolve inside the right stack:
   `{ "context": { "packs": ["gcp", "devops"] } }`; pin one node with its own
   `"pack"`. The build refuses, before writing anything and listing every
   problem (exit 1), a spec whose edges or parents name something that does not
   exist, or whose numbers are not numbers (a string `col`, a size of 0 or
   less). Fix the spec; never drop the edge. A missing `col` or `row` is 0. An
   unknown node or edge `kind` still builds and is listed under `unknownKinds`:
   fix it or report it. Hand-written XML is only for what the spec cannot
   express — see `references/editing.md`.

5. **Never overwrite blind.** The builder backs up an existing file first and
   keeps the oldest backup plus the newest five (`--keep-backups N`; `0` keeps
   all). Every other edit — MCP `set_page`, a hand edit — goes `analyze → back
   up → edit → validate`, and the backup is `node scripts/backup.mjs "<file>"`
   before the first write. Suggest `*.backup-*` for the user's `.gitignore`.

6. **Validate.**
   ```bash
   node scripts/validate-drawio.mjs "path/to/diagram.drawio"   # --page N for one page
   ```
   Errors must be fixed. Overlap, tight-label and caption-crossing warnings are
   judgement calls: check them against the render.

7. **Render and look at it.**
   ```bash
   node scripts/render-drawio.mjs "path/to/diagram.drawio" --out-dir .analysis/renders --width 2200
   ```
   Needs local Draw.io Desktop. Read the PNG back as an image and iterate until
   spacing, hierarchy, routing and labels hold up; a diagram that validates but
   reads badly is not done. If the export fails, see `references/rendering.md`;
   if it cannot be fixed, report 🔴 and fall back to validate-only — never skip
   the look silently. A render of a user's diagram stays local.

8. **Open it on request** in Draw.io Desktop or the VS Code extension. Never
   send the user to the hosted web editor with their diagram.

9. **Report** under these headings, every one, even when it is short:
   **File** · **Assumptions** (every one, asked or not, and any product the
   user did not name) · **Icons** (each id and pack; any not confident or not
   found; logos downloaded and from where; lifecycle caveats) · **Validation**
   · **Render** (you looked at the PNG, or it failed and why — never
   "rendered" for a render that failed) · **Deviations** from the style guide.

## Interview first

**Ask only what would change the drawing, and only someone who can answer.**
A request that names its components and flows is drawn, not questioned — even
with a product or a source left unnamed: pick the common choice, draw, and list
it under Assumptions.

A diagram is a claim about someone's system; a wrong claim drawn well gets
believed. Ask **one question at a time**, each with your **recommended answer**
and a one-line reason, in dependency order, feeding answers forward. **Never ask
about styling** — that is this skill's job. Skip a branch the request already
answers or that cannot change the drawing:

1. **Purpose and audience** — who reads it, what decision it supports. Everything below depends on it.
2. **Scope** — what is inside, and what is deliberately outside.
3. **Level** — one box per service, container or team; never mixed.
4. **State** — as-is, to-be, or both (two pages or one comparison).
5. **Components by real product name** — "Snowflake", not "the warehouse"; this picks the packs.
6. **Flows** — what moves, which way, sync or event-driven; only those worth an arrow.
7. **Boundaries** — trust, network, ownership, account; they become the containers.
8. **What must be visible** — failure paths, multi-region, HA/DR, a control under review.
9. **Pages** — split by lifecycle stage or audience, not by how much fits.
10. **Unknowns** — agree up front: a stated assumption or a labelled placeholder, never invention.

**Stop when** the remaining unknowns could not change the drawing: a three-box
flow needs two questions, a review-board architecture needs the ladder. Write
the answers down; they are the report's assumptions and the canvas note.

## Safety — always

- The user's diagrams stay on the machine. Nothing is uploaded.
- With the Draw.io MCP server, use only `list_pages`, `get_page`, `set_page` and
  `search_shapes`. **Never** call `open_drawio_xml`, `open_drawio_csv` or
  `open_drawio_mermaid` on anything derived from the user's content: they open
  the hosted editor and send the architecture off the machine.
- The only network requests are public logos. Search the product name alone —
  never a customer, codename, hostname or anything else from the diagram.
- Never read a whole existing diagram into context; embedded images run to
  megabytes. `references/editing.md` says how to work on one.

## Non-negotiables

- Editable `.drawio` XML is the deliverable; icons and logos embed in the cell.
- Real marks for named products, transparent backgrounds; an honest labelled box
  where none exists, named in the report.
- Orthogonal routing, captions under icons, a legend when more than one
  connector kind is used, assumptions on the canvas.
- Corners, connector meanings, colours and type sizes follow the house style
  unless this install's applied override (`--print-style`) says otherwise.
