description: Create or edit editable Excalidraw (.excalidraw) diagrams — system and solution architectures for any cloud or stack, software component and block diagrams, data pipelines, agentic/LLM systems, network and deployment views, flows and decision paths — in a hand-drawn house style, using Excalidraw's own default libraries plus custom icons built from real product logos. Use whenever the request involves an Excalidraw scene or library, an architecture or block diagram wanted in a sketchy style, an icon built from a product logo, or an edit to an existing .excalidraw file.

# Architecture diagrams in Excalidraw

Produces native, editable `.excalidraw` JSON — never a flattened image, never
Mermaid as the final artifact. Any cloud, any stack. The builder applies the
house style, binds the arrows and embeds the icons; you write a small JSON spec.
Scripts live in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/arkitect-excalidraw/scripts`.

## What to read

Read only what the task needs. Every path is relative to this skill.

| Task | Read |
|---|---|
| Draw a new scene | this file, the one pattern you pick in step 2, and one worked example (step 4) |
| Edit an existing `.excalidraw` | `references/editing.md` |
| An item the search cannot find, an unnamed library item, a logo, a public library | `references/icons.md` |
| Rendering fails, or the user wants the real app | `references/rendering.md` |
| Hand-written scene JSON | `references/excalidraw-format.md` |
| A deliberate deviation from the house style, or its evidence | `references/style-guide.md` |

If `~/.arkitect/excalidraw/style-notes.md` or `patterns.md` exist
(`$ARKITECT_HOME/excalidraw/` when set), read them too: they are what
`/learn-excalidraw-style` found in the user's own scenes, and they win over the
shipped guide. Say so in the report.

The builder already draws the corpus's habits: elbow arrows at stroke width 4,
edge captions beside the line, dashed-rectangle regions, captions below shapes.
Do not undo them by hand.

## Workflow

1. **Decide whether to ask** — see Interview first, below. Most requests are
   drawn straight away, with the assumptions stated.

2. **Pick a pattern and state assumptions.** Choose the nearest, then read
   only that `## N.` section of `references/pattern-catalog.md`:
   1 pipeline · 2 scope or trust box · 3 tiers · 4 request with a decision ·
   5 current vs proposed · 6 external systems · 7 one service's inside ·
   8 agentic/LLM · 9 ordered protocol · 10 legend · 11 sources into one store ·
   12 tables inside a product · 13 big phases (CI/CD) · 14 one tool, many
   outputs · 15 naming convention · 16 two diagrams, one canvas · 17 unwired
   components. Prefer 11–17, the corpus's own shapes, when the system fits.
   Spec fragments: `assets/templates/patterns.json`. Write every assumption
   down for the report and, where it matters, a note on the canvas.
   **An assumption fills a gap the user left open; it never overrides a stated
   fact.** Never add, remove or renumber a component they specified: if the
   stated count draws awkwardly, draw the stated count and say the layout is
   tight.

3. **Resolve icons — bundled libraries first.**
   ```bash
   node scripts/find-icon.mjs "postgres" --compact
   ```
   Put the ref from a match in the spec: `"icon": "data-platform:9"`. A node
   that only names its component resolves by product name alone; the search says
   what it would draw (`"draws"`) or why it gets a placeholder. Shared packs fill
   gaps (`"icon": "drawio:databases/postgresql"`). Unnamed library items:
   `references/icons.md`. **Otherwise use a placeholder and move on**:
   `kind: "placeholder"`, or an unresolvable `icon`, draws a dotted `?` slot
   named under `placeholders` in the build report. Do not fetch a logo unless
   asked, and **never** use one product's mark for another.

4. **Build from a spec.** First see which style this install draws with:
   ```bash
   node scripts/build-diagram.mjs --print-style
   node scripts/build-diagram.mjs my-spec.json --out "path/to/architecture.excalidraw"
   ```
   Write the spec next to the output file, never inside this skill's folder.
   With `"source": "override"` (the user's own conventions), pick each edge
   `kind` by its `meaning` there and keep the tokens it changed. A non-empty
   `style.errors` means the override was ignored: tell the user. Never pass
   `--defaults` for a user's scene.

   **Look at one worked example's PNG before writing a spec**, then its spec:
   `assets/templates/starter-architecture.spec.json` for every node and
   connector kind, or `assets/templates/aws-data-platform.spec.json` for a
   large real answer (regions per phase, sublabels, an error lane, assumptions
   on the canvas, fractional `col`/`row`).

   The build writes nothing and lists every problem (exit 1) when an edge or
   parent names something missing or a number is not one (a string `col`, a
   size ≤ 0). Edges connect nodes, not boundaries. Fix the spec; never drop the
   edge. A missing `col` or `row` is 0. The report lists an unknown `kind` under
   `unknownKinds` (fix or report it) and an edge through a node it does not
   connect under `crossings` (move that node). Hand-written JSON only for what
   the spec cannot express: `references/editing.md`.

5. **Never overwrite blind.** The builder backs up an existing file, keeping the
   oldest plus the newest five (`--keep-backups N`, `0` keeps all). Every other
   edit goes `analyze → back up → edit → validate`, and the backup is
   `node scripts/backup.mjs "<file>"` before the first write. Suggest
   `*.backup-*` for the user's `.gitignore`.

6. **Validate.**
   ```bash
   node scripts/validate-excalidraw.mjs "path/to/architecture.excalidraw"
   ```
   Errors block delivery. Overlap, tight-label and crossing warnings are
   judgement calls: check them against the render.

7. **Render and look at it.**
   ```bash
   node scripts/render-excalidraw.mjs "path/to/architecture.excalidraw" --out-dir .analysis/renders --width 2200
   ```
   Needs a local Edge, Chrome or Chromium; with none it exits 1 — fall back to
   `--format svg` and say you could not look at a PNG. If the error says to
   retry with `--no-sandbox`, do so once. Read the PNG back and
   iterate; a scene that validates but reads badly is not done. The preview is
   geometry-faithful, not font-faithful: judge layout, not typography. First
   renders nearly always need, in the spec:
   - a long region label overrunning: one or two words, detail in sublabels;
   - an elbow through a third icon, or two stacked into one line: `"route": "straight"`.

8. **Open it in the real app** when the user wants to, and before claiming it
   looks right in Excalidraw itself: `references/rendering.md`.

9. **Report** under these headings, every one, even when it is short:
   **File** · **Assumptions** (every one, asked or not, and any product the
   user did not name) · **Icons** (each ref and where it came from: bundled
   library, shared pack, a logo you built; every placeholder) · **Validation**
   · **Render** (you looked at the PNG, or it failed and why — never
   "rendered" for a render that failed) · **Deviations** from the style guide.
   Offer nothing Arkitect cannot do: there is no PowerPoint or PDF export.

## Interview first

**Ask only what would change the drawing, and only someone who can answer.**
A request that names its components and flows is drawn, not questioned — even
with a product or a source left unnamed: pick the common choice, draw, and list
it under Assumptions.

A diagram is a claim about someone's system; a wrong claim drawn well gets
believed. Ask **one question at a time**, each with your **recommended answer**
and a one-line reason, in dependency order, feeding answers forward. **Never ask
about styling** — that is this skill's job. Skip a branch the request already
answers or that cannot change the drawing:

1. **Purpose and audience** — who reads it, what decision it supports. Everything below depends on it.
2. **Scope** — what is inside, and what is deliberately outside.
3. **Level** — one box per service, container or team; never mixed.
4. **State** — as-is, to-be, or both (two pages or one comparison).
5. **Components by real product name** — "Snowflake", not "the warehouse"; this decides the icons.
6. **Flows** — what moves, which way, sync or event-driven; only those worth an arrow.
7. **Boundaries** — trust, network, ownership, account; they become the containers.
8. **What must be visible** — failure paths, multi-region, HA/DR, a control under review.
9. **Pages** — split by lifecycle stage or audience, not by how much fits.
10. **Unknowns** — agree up front: a stated assumption or a labelled placeholder, never invention.

**Stop when** the remaining unknowns could not change the drawing: a three-box
flow needs two questions, a review-board architecture needs the ladder. Write
the answers down; they are the report's assumptions and the canvas note.

## Safety — always

- The user's scenes stay on the machine. Nothing is uploaded; the local
  Excalidraw container has no backend.
- The only network requests are public logos and the public library catalogue,
  and only when asked. Search the product name alone — never a customer,
  codename, hostname or anything else from the diagram.
- Never read a whole existing scene into context; embedded images run to
  megabytes of base64. `references/editing.md` says how to work on one.

## Non-negotiables

- Editable `.excalidraw` JSON is the deliverable; images embed in the scene's
  `files`, never linked.
- Every arrow bound at both ends, so the diagram survives being dragged around.
- A missing icon is an obvious placeholder named in the report, never another
  product's mark or a grey box passed off as finished.
- Excalidraw's font sizes, stroke widths and palette plus the house accents; a
  product's brand colour where the diagram is about it.
- A legend whenever more than one connector kind is used; assumptions on the
  canvas.
